// t0.mjs — TIER 0 · the conductor's brain when there is NO model at all.
//
// The page could describe fall-os but handed a visitor nothing to use: the demo forked
// "candidate 1", "candidate 2" — it SHOWED the core and DID nothing. This organ is what makes the
// conductor usable on the visitor's own words with zero setup: no key, no download, no server, no
// network. It is the EXPLORE organ that `conduct()` calls, so the five phases run on real input.
//
// WHAT IT HONESTLY IS: a deterministic decision-framing tool. It does not understand the sentence.
// It looks for SIGNALS it can name (cue words), and forks a fixed taxonomy of decision STANCES
// scored against those signals. That is a real, useful thing — a scored field of stances grounded
// in evidence quoted back from your own text, with the rejected ones kept as roads-not-taken.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOT: a language model. It cannot paraphrase you, and it never pretends to. Every score
// is traceable to a cue word it will show you, and when it finds nothing it SAYS so rather than
// inventing a reading. `evidence()` is exported precisely so the UI can display the basis — a score
// a visitor cannot audit is a number they have no reason to trust.
//
// Tier 1 (in-browser WebLLM) and above phrase these stances against the specific decision. They
// improve the WORDING. The field, the gate and the shadow are this file either way.

// ── SIGNALS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Each signal is a named thing to look for, with the literal cues that count as finding it. Cues are
// matched on word boundaries so "user" does not fire inside "users" by accident of substring — plural
// forms are listed where they are wanted. Deliberately small and readable: a visitor can check it.
